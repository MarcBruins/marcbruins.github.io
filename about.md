Hi, I am Marc Bruins. I'm a Xamarin and Microsoft MVP specialized in mobile technologies. You can often find me speaking and [training](https://university.xamarin.com/team) at various conferences and events. 

A great passion of mine is open source. It is really rewarding work if you do something for the community and i believe more companies and people should get involved. I've created several libraries and i'm active for the [MvvmCross](https://www.mvvmcross.com) project.

Feel free to contact [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcbruins) or send an email to marc (at) marcbruins.nl
